# 👩‍💻 Hi, I'm Roaa

I’m an **Information Systems engineering student** currently completing my degree through a **work-study program**.  
I enjoy building **practical systems that solve real problems**, exploring **data pipelines, software architecture, and system design**, while always asking *why* each piece fits in the bigger picture.  

I’m constantly expanding my skills in **cloud computing, security, and AI**, while applying what I already know in my projects.

## 🧭 My Approach

I like to combine **code, design, and analysis** to make systems work efficiently.  
I focus on creating **projects that are not only functional, but maintainable and understandable**, so they can grow and adapt over time.
